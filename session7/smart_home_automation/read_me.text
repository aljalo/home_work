Exercise 2: Smart Home Automation
A smart home system controls different devices such as lights, air conditioners, and security
cameras.
Each device has an on and off functionality.
Some devices have additional functionalities, e.g., adjusting temperature or motion detection.
The system should allow multiple devices to be controlled together.
Question:
How would you design a system where different devices share common functionalities but also have
unique behaviors?
